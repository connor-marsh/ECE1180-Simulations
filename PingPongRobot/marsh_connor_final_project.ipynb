    "# Introduction\n",
    "This notebook will model two main things, rigid-body physics, and robotic control systems, both focused around the application of a ping pong playing robot.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Physics\n",
    "Rigid-body physics: The physics will pertain to bouncing and rolling of a ping pong ball off of arbitrarily sized, positioned, and rotated, rigid body spheres, rectangular prisms, and cylinders (maybe). I wanted to make a general rigid-body simulation for completeness, but in the end all we really need is just the physics of a ball on a flat table, and an arbitrarily positioned and rotated paddle. The paddle will be made up of either two cylinders, or two rectangular prisms, which would form the handle and the paddle surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Control\n",
    "Robotic control systems: The first step is to simulate control over the paddle where we can magically set the paddles position and rotation or 6 degrees of freedom (DOF). The second step would be to attach the paddle to the end of a 6-DOF robot arm and control it via inverse kinematics of the robot arm, and simulating motor torques etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why we are simulating\n",
    "I have the goal of getting an actual robot arm to play ping pong. The actual robot arm that I have is very expensive and I don't want to risk damaging it with potentially buggy/nonfunctional code. By simulating the ping pong physics and robot control, we can test our control code in a virtual safe space, and see how the robot arm will move and if it will take actions that could be damaging to the physical arm. When we are happy with the results of the simulated robot, we can carefully and slowly move features onto the physical robot!\n",
    "\n",
    "Another benefit of having it in simulation, is we can change things that we couldn't change on the physical robot, like increasing the simulation speed, to run many simulations of different control gains or strategies or things like to experimentally find the optimal solution in a way that just wouldn't be plausible on the feasible robot. We could even run reinforcement learning algorithms like [Proximal Policy Optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal_policy_optimization) on the simulated arm, which requires trying and failing at a task thousands of times.\n",
    "\n",
    "So for these reasons of safety and convenience it is a no brainer that simulating this scenario will be greatly beneficial to the development of this robot arm application!"

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "## Physics\n",
    "At its core this notebook is a rigid-body physics simulation. The ball will be affected by gravity, and then bounce off or roll on whichever surfaces it collides with. For bouncing collisions, we will assume that balls mass to be negligible compared to the mass of the paddle/table, so the paddle/table will not budge at all under a collision.\n",
    "\n",
    "When bouncing, the balls velocity vector will be reflected across the normal of the surface it's colliding with.\n",
    "\n",
    "When rolling, the ball will have component forces of gravity pushing it in it's rolling state based off the normal of the surface it is rolling on. **I ended up not having time to implement rolling physics, and focused on just having the robot always be bouncing the ball off the paddle or other surfaces.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some equations that are being used for the physics:\n",
    "### Numerical Equations:\n",
    "For the simulation of the ball movements, we are doing simple semi-implicit numerical integration of the balls position based off its velocity and gravity. This is no different than the very first project from this class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analytical Equations:\n",
    "#### Trajectory equations\n",
    "Given acceleration $\\vec{a}$ and initial velocity and position $\\vec{v_0}, \\vec{r_0}$. The position at a given time is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\vec{r}(t) = \\vec{r_0} + \\vec{v_0}t + \\frac{1}{2} \\vec{a} t^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to intercept the ball when it reaches a certain height $y_d$, based off its initial velocity and position $v,y$ we know that the time that it reaches that height will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$t_d = \\frac{v \\pm \\sqrt{v^2-2g(y_d-y)}}{g}$ and the position and velocity at that time is simply $\\vec{r}(t_d)$, $\\vec{v}(t_d)$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to control the ball, we need to know with what velocity to hit it to make it reach a desired position. The velocity needed for the ball to reach a desired position, given an initial position is a bit more complex. First of all, it has infinite solutions. Given any trajectory that points sufficiently up enough, there will be a velocity that will make the ball reach the target. We can format this as an optimization problem, where we want to choose a trajectory that minimizes ball velocity, but to simplify things lets just assume the trajectory is always pointing towards the target in the horizontal plane, and pointing 45 degrees upwards from that plane. Lastly we need to define a few terms:\n",
    "Desired position: $\\vec{r_f}$, initial position: $\\vec{r_i}$, taking their difference $\\vec{r_f}-\\vec{r_i}$ and flattening onto the horizontal plane we will call $\\vec{r_d}$\n",
    "Distance: $d=|\\vec{r_d}|$, Angle: $\\theta$. Given all that we have\n",
    "\n",
    "$v = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\frac{1}{2}g\\frac{d}{\\cos{\\theta}}^2}{d\\tan{\\theta}+\\vec{r_{yi}}-\\vec{r_{yf}}}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Collisions\n",
    "Now that we know the desired initial velocity of the ball to take it from one location to another, we need to find with what speed and orientation the paddle should be in order to hit the ball with that velocity, given the balls pre-collision velocity as well. Now this problem has no analytical solution, but we can solve it numerically. If the paddle has no velocity, then its easy to know what its orientation should be. The normal of the paddle should be the vector that bisects the incoming and desired outgoing velocity vectors of the ball. But when the paddle has velocity, the proper location of this normal gets shifted. We can have an initial guess for the paddle's orientation as the bisecting normal, then we know that the correct normal will be somewhere on the line in 3d space between the initial velocity and desired outgoing velocity. If the paddle is moving towards the ball, the normal should be pointing more towards the desired outgoing velocity, and vice versa. My dirty and quick solution (because I didn't have time to fully solve) was to randomly sample points along that line in 3d space for the paddles normal, and then from there calculate the velocity. Given the paddles initial normal we can analytically find the best velocity for that normal, although it isn't a simple equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "First off we need to know what the outgoing velocity $\\vec{v_o}$ of the ball will be after a collision with the paddle with normal $\\hat{n}$ and velocity $\\vec{v_p}$, when the ball has incoming velocity $\\vec{v_i}$\n",
    "\n",
    "If the paddle was stationary and the collision was perfectly elastic, then we know $\\frac{\\hat{v_o}+\\hat{v_i}}{\\vec{v_o} \\cdot \\vec{v_i}}=\\hat{n}$. We can solve this for $\\vec{v_0}$ by doing a reflection. Then we can adjust it by a vector determined based off the paddle velocity and collision coefficient of restitution $\\alpha$\n",
    "\n",
    "The collision only \"sees\" the velocity that is projected onto the collision normal, any other velocity gets ignored. So we know that the collision velocity $v_1=\\vec{v_o} \\cdot \\hat{n}$ and $v_2=\\vec{v_p} \\cdot \\hat{n}$\n",
    "\n",
    "If the ball and paddle have masses $m_1, m_2$ then the the outgoing velocity of the ball (projected on the normal) is equal to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$v_o = (1+\\alpha)\\frac{m_1v_1+m_2v_2}{m_1+m_2} - \\alpha v_1$\n",
    "\n",
    "We will assume that the paddle has infinite mass relative to the ping pong ball and won't be affected by the collision which simplifies this equation to be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$v_o = (1+\\alpha)v_2 - \\alpha v_1$\n",
    "\n",
    "This magnitude will added to the velocity from before (when we assumed stationary paddle and perfect elasticity) along the direction of the normal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can find the desired paddle velocity! One important simplification is that we know the paddles velocity will be projected on the normal, so we don't need to bother giving its velocity any direction that isn't equal to the normal. We are assuming that ball spin has no affect on our physics, which allows us to make this simplification. So the desired magnitude of the velocity of the paddle (along the normal) is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$v_p = \\frac{v_o - \\alpha v_1}{1+\\alpha}$\n",
    "\n",
    "So we have our guessed normal, we calculate $v_p$ as above, then we calculate the ball's trajectory based off of $v_p$ and $\\hat{n}$, and see how close it is to our desired trajetory. Then we adjust the guessed $\\hat{n}$ and try again, until we reach a trajectory with sufficiently low error!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Collision detection\n",
    "As always is true with physics simulations/video games. Collision detection is an extremely complex topic that even triple A game studios can't get perfectly right. This is evidenced if you've ever watched a speedrun of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. One of the most technically advanced video games ever created in this modern era, yet the player is still easily able to break the games collision detection system and clip through walls. My point here is that I'm not going to include equations for my collision detection because it's too complex to easily represent with equations, but I'll represent it in words.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm only checking for collisions between the ball (a sphere) and then either sphere entities or box entities. The collision with another sphere is trivial. The collision with a box is a bit more complicated. For each side of the box, we can extend that side to be an entire plane, and we can get the distance between the sphere and that plane using some linear algebra and the plane's normal. We can then check if the sphere is touching a plane by seeing if the difference is less than its radius. If it is touching a plane, we need to make sure that it is between the four other planes that would bound that side of the box. So it's distance between each set of sides need to be greater than 0 for one side and less than 0 for the other, otherwise that would mean it is outside of the bounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Control\n",
    "\n",
    "### My initial thoughts at the start of the project\n",
    "In the first step, the robot's state will be represented as the position and velocity of the ball, followed by the position and rotation of the paddle.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second step, the robot's state will be the same, but we will need the velocities and angular velocities of the paddle as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two control modes will be bouncing and rolling, and I will likely implement some sort of sliding mode when the ball is bouncing at a very high frequency. A sliding mode is when the objects state space moves along the edge of the boundary between two different modes, known as the sliding surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the bouncing mode, we can do closed form integration of the balls trajectory, given an initial velocity and position, and then determine where we want to move the paddle to, to intercept it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the rolling mode, we will do either PID or state-feedback control to determine how we should position and rotate the paddle to achieve the desired ball position.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What I actually did\n",
    "So because we can find the desired velocity of the paddle to hit the ball to any desired location. This actually simplifies the control a lot (and also I never implemented rolling, which the control of that is way more complicated) because all we have to do is control the paddle to the desired velocity! The physical robot arm I have has actuators with built in position control, so we don't have to do any advanced manipulator control like [resolved motion rate control](https://roboticsknowledgebase.com/wiki/planning/resolved-rates/), and we can instead just make a path of end effector positions with desired times for the manipulator to reach that position. We can then use inverse kinematics to find the joint angles needed to reach that position, and just send those angles to the actuators which have their own closed loop position control on those angles. We then step through the positions in our path at the times denoted, which will have the effect of moving the end effector (ping pong paddle) at the desired velocity!"

    "## Course Concepts\n",
    "This project is similar to the first 3 projects from the class as it is mostly a physics simulation. Like those projects it uses continuous space and continuous time (assuming small enough dt means its continuous). Each simulation loop the time will increase by the timestep, and objects will move by an amount equal to their velocity times the timestep. For updating the objects positions and velocity, this simulation uses the semi-implicit technique, since it is the most straight-forward, and also is numerically stable. I used the same equations of \"ball falling\" and \"ball bouncing\" as the basis for my simulation. I started out my simulation process by essentially recreating project 1. The other equations I used didn't come directly from anything we learned in this class, but I used the same methods of researching the physics to find proper equations and rules to use!"

    "# Verification Process\n",
    "## Physics\n",
    "### Qualitative Verification\n",
    "I initially qualitatively verified my model just by watching the ball bounce around on objects, and comparing it to my mental model of how that is supposed to look. Later I further verified it by using [Physion Physics Engine](https://physion.net/) to recreate one of my scenarios and looking at the two results there and seeing that they were the same (enough). Physion is a 2d engine, so I created a 3d setup where only 1 vertical plane of the setup is relevant. In the **Testing Objects** section later, you will see something similar to the setup I used to compare to Physion, but it is a bit more complicated because I added 3d only rotation of the objects to make it more complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the setup I used in Physion:  \n",
    "![My attempt at Physion](./assets/physionSim.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a similar setup in my simulation:  \n",
    "![Similar to Physion setup](./assets/twoSlopesBouncing.png)  \n",
    "As you can see, these setups aren't identical, but they both represent a similar enough scenario of the ball bouncing back and forth between two sloped planes, and I qualitatively verified that they both behaved in the same way.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quantitative verification\n",
    "#### PhET\n",
    "For quantitative verification I initially used the PhET onlines labs, both [PhET Collision Lab](https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/collision-lab/latest/collision-lab_all.html) and [PhET Projectile Motion Lab](https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/projectile-motion/latest/projectile-motion_all.html) to confirm that my math for my analytical projectile motion, and the collisions were correct. The projectile motion lab is only 2d, but once the ball has its initial velocity, projectile motion is always constrained to the 2d vertical plane along which the ball travels, so 3d projectile motion is inherently 2d at its core.\n",

    "![PhET Trajectory Pic](./assets/phetTrajectorySim.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Self-verifying\n",
    "I also somewhat self verified, as in a later feature in my simulation proved that earlier features work correctly. In the background section I discuss how I analytically solve for ball trajectories, and paddle velocities needed to hit the ball to a target position. Well in the **Testing Control** section, you'll see that when given a target position, and putting the paddle at the calculated initial velocity, it hits the ball to the correct position, meaning that the model had to have been correct!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Control\n",
    "I didn't have time to get too deep into the control of the robot, but when doing just the ball bouncing and not ball rolling the control is really quite simple. Especially because my robots actuators have internal position feedback like I mentioned earlier. The only control setup I had time to do is in the **Testing Control** section, which shows the *\"robot\"* can hit the ball to a target location.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the future I could further verify the control by running the program on my actual robot arm, and see how it compares to the simulation if I used the same control gains and whatnot.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this to work we need closed loop feedback on the position of the ball. I also have access to an XBox360 Kinect (RGBD Camera essentially) which we can use to track the location of the ball. This would obviously add noise and a time delay to the control, so I can try simulating noise and time delay as well!"

    "## Scenario 1\n",
    "### Title\n",
    "Two sloped boxes\n",
    "### Initial conditions and parameters\n",
    "The ball starts with no initial velocity, above two boxes that are both pointing at eachother around 45 degrees. One of the boxes is also slightly rotated in the third dimension, causing the ball to move towards the camera slightly when it bounces off it.\n",
    "### What it represents/Why I included\n",
    "This scenario represents the ball having accurate collision detection and collision physics with sloped boxes, which is a challenging and important feature of a rigid body physics simulation, and is needed for the ping pong paddle to work accurately\n",
    "### Verification vs Experimental\n",
    "This scenario is for qualitative verification. This scenario is slightly modified from the qualitative scenario I mentioned earlier that I compared to the Physion simulation. The only different is the slight rotation in the third dimension of the other box. So I compared it to Physion when the box didn't have the slight rotation, then I added the slight rotation and I compared it to my mental model of how it should move\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scenario 2\n",
    "### Title\n",
    "Ping Pong table between two walls\n",
    "### Initial conditions and parameters\n",
    "The ball starts with a high initial velocity in the x direction, and slight velocity in the z direction, sitting above an accurately sized ping pong table which is sitting between two large walls. The ball bounces up and around back and forth on the table and walls, eventually hitting the net, and losing enough vertical velocity that it \"rolls\" along the table while bouncing back and forth between the net and wall. I say \"rolls\" because there is no actual rolling physics, it just is being held up by the table and sliding back and forth.\n",
    "### What it represents/Why I included\n",
    "I included this to see what would happen when I push the edgecases of the ball going into a \"rolling\" state, and colliding with multiple objects at once. It's also testing the ping pong table, which is a hybrid object made up of a net and a table. This is useful because the ping pong paddle is also a hybrid object made up of handle and paddle.\n",
    "### Verification vs Experimental\n",
    "This scenario is more experimental, but you can also observe the result as a qualitative verification\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scenario 3\n",
    "### Title\n",
    "Control paddle to hit ball to destination\n",
    "### Initial conditions and parameters\n",
    "The ball starts with no initial velocity, sitting above a ping pong paddle with a random upwards pointing normal. There is also a yellow sphere with a random position, this is the destination. The ball falls onto this paddle and then gains a random trajectory. Then the paddle control kicks in, causing it to move in a way that intercepts the ball when it reaches the initial height of the bounce, and collides with the ball in a way that gives it the velocity needed to travel through the yellow sphere\n",
    "### What it represents/Why I included\n",
    "I included this to test that the paddle velocity control is correct. This is crucially important for getting the robot to control the ball\n",
    "### Verification vs Experimental\n",
    "This scenario was for quantiative self-verification. As I mentioned in the **Verification Process** section, for the ball to reach the destination, everything else about my model *must* be correct. I already quantiatively verified my collision and trajectory equations using PhET, so the only variable still is the model/numerical integration simulation. So because the velocity of the paddle is being calculated using verified analytical equations, if the ball reaches the destination, then the model/simulation *must* be accurate. And as you'll see, it is!\n",

    "## Scenario 4\n",
    "### Title\n",
    "Rendering robot arm from Universal Robot Description Format file (URDF) and controlling it with inverse kinematics\n",
    "### Initial conditions and parameters\n",
    "We render a robot arm, and give it a desired path to follow, which is just a straight line across the range of places it can reach. And also a target orientation of the end effector, which is just pointing up. On each time step we calculate the desired joint angles using IK, and then render the arm with those joint angles. And also render the goal end effector position as a green sphere.\n",
    "### What it represents/Why I included\n",
    "I included this to test the control of the robot arm, and as a pre-requisite for inserting the robot arm into the main simulation, and attaching the ping pong paddle to it etc.\n",
    "### Verification vs Experimental\n",
    "This scenario is more experimental, as I haven't had time to get too deep into including the model of the robot arm in the simulation. But its also been verified, as the URDF file I used is based off of the actual robot arm that I have. And I ran the IK both in the simulation and on the real arm, and the real arm was able to do the path tracking that you'll see in the simulation. I should've gotten a video of the arm doing this but I forgot and don't have time to get one now. In the coming week if I get the arm working more, I might post an update that includes the physical arm working."

    "# Evaluation\n",
    "## How my results relate\n",
    "My results are extremely relevant to my justification! In general my simulation worked really well and is addressing a lot of my problems/questions that inspired me to make it. The only limiting factor is having more time to add more features.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the results you saw that the simulation can accurately simulation the motion of a ping pong ball colliding with arbitratrily positioned and rotated objects. That we can control a ping pong paddle to move to any desired postiion. And that we have setup a model of a robot arm which can track a target position.\n",
    "\n",
    "These results mean that all of my assumptions about how this system would work are correct, and I am actually not too far from getting to my desired goal of getting the robot to playing ping pong. Without this simulation, it would have been much harder and more dangerous (danger in terms of breaking expensive hardware) to get to where I am right now!\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are limitations of the model\n",
    "### Spin\n",
    "The model currently doesn't account for ball spin, which in real life will effect the trajectory a notable amount\n",
    "### Air disturbances/wind\n",
    "The model assumes the air is perfectly still, and doesn't includ any noise that would happen in real life.\n",
    "### Robot control errors\n",
    "In real life we wouldn't be able to control the robot to move to exactly the right location with the exact right velocity all the time. There would be small errors which would effect the balls trajectory.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Given the limitations, how can I overcome them and continue to explore\n",
    "All three limitations I just referenced prevent the ball from moving in the exact ways that the simulation expects. But the simulation is using open loop control on the ball, its assuming it will move perfectly as expected. To overcome this, we can use a sensor to track the location of the ball and close the loop. All the paddle velocity and trajectory planning concepts that I mentioned, can be recomputed several times throughout the balls trajectory in the air, insuring that any errors that are introduced are compensated for!\n",
    "\n",
    "I can also continue to explore by simulating these limitations. Add random noise to the air, and robot movements. And also simulate ball spin!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenges\n",
    "I encountered a lot of challenges in terms of this being a complicated problem. But I was able to overcome them through many hours of debugging and research. Right now the project is at a point where there is no feature that I haven't been able to accomplish yet!\n",
    "\n",
    "Another challenge with this project was the limitation of vpython and jupyter notebooks being very slow. In the future I would plan to overcome these challenges by either further optimizing my code, and/or switching from vpython/jupyter to pyopengl (or another more efficient 3d rendering program) and just individual python files.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Given approach and relevant course concepts, what alternative approches could be valid?\n",
    "Other valid approaches could include using reinforcement learning based control, like PPO which I mentioned earlier, instead of fully needing to calculate all the equations for finding optimal paddle velocities etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of the physics part, I think there is really no good replacement for this method. Trajectories over time can't really be done analytically when there are collisions/discontinuities involved, so the numerical integration technique really is the best solution for simulating the physics. And simulating the physics is required for testing the control simulations, whether its PPO or my analytical trajectory calculating paddle velocity finding stuff.\n",
    "\n",
    "If I weren't to use simulation at all, I would struggle greatly with debugging, as there are so many things that need to be done correctly before the robot arm can do anything remotely useful.\n",
    "I could take alternative routes like using the xbox kinect/3d camera to track the ball and paddle as I swing it with my own arms, and write prediction code based on collision parameters, and then compare it to what the kinect tracks. But that would be much more difficult that just this simulation that I did"

    "# Conclusions and Future Work\n",
    "All in all this went really well and I am really happy with the result! The simulation is able to accurately determine the paddle velocity needed to hit the ball to a desired location, and then figure out the robot arm joint angles needed to move to a certain position. The only step missing that I haven't had time to implement, is connecting those features. And making it so that the desired paddle velocity would create a robot arm trajectory to follow, which would be used for computing the joint angles.\n",
    "\n",
    "I plan on continuing with this project over the next week before I go home for the summer. Hopefully I will get the robot arm fully working within the simulation, and maybe partially working in real life (although I'd have to work super efficiently to get that done on time).\n",
    "\n",
    "Other features I could include would be simulating ball rolling, spin, noise, different types of control, different geometrical shapes for the ball to bounce on, and much more!"
